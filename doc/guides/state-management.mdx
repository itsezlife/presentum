## Overview

Presentum provides several ways to manage state. Guards are the primary tool, but you can also use direct state changes for immediate user actions.

## Basic state change

```dart
context.presentum<CampaignItem, AppSurface, CampaignVariant>().setState((state) {
  state.setActive(AppSurface.homeTopBanner, campaignItem);
  state.enqueue(AppSurface.profileAlert, alertItem);
  return state;
});
```

## Declarative API

You can do anything with state:

```dart
// Push to surface
await presentum.pushSlot(AppSurface.homeTopBanner, item: campaignItem);

// Mark events
await presentum.markShown(item);
await presentum.markDismissed(item);
await presentum.markConverted(item);

// Remove items
await presentum.removeById('campaign-123');
```

<Info>
  Guards should be your primary tool for scheduling presentations, removing
  ineligible items, periodic refreshes, and complex eligibility rules. Use
  direct state changes when you need explicit control.
